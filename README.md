# Ad Metrics Test

## Part 1

Based on the [dummy data](https://github.com/FranciscoGalan/michael_page_test/blob/main/Dummy%20data%20for%20test%20PS%20analytic.xlsx) , I wrote an [SQL query](https://github.com/FranciscoGalan/michael_page_test/blob/main/Solution_query.sql) that gets the requested [Result Table](https://github.com/FranciscoGalan/michael_page_test/blob/main/result_table.csv), as described on the [accompanying Word file](https://github.com/FranciscoGalan/michael_page_test/blob/main/Improvado%20test%20for%20PS%20analyst%20(1)%20(1).docx).

Clic [the link to see the final query](https://github.com/FranciscoGalan/michael_page_test/blob/main/Solution_query.sql) with the solution.



## Part 2

Then, based on the Result Table, I build a dashboard on Tableau Public, as described on the accompanying Word file. (Again, click the link to go to the dashboard).
